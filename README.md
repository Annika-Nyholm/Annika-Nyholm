### Hi there! üëã

I'm **Annika Nyholm**, a former pharmacy technician who has embarked on an exciting new journey towards becoming a **Front End Developer**. My background might be in healthcare, but my passion for creativity and problem-solving led me to the world of coding, and I couldn't be happier with the decision!

### About Me:
- üíª I'm currently studying Front End Development at YH Mediainstitutet, where I'm learning everything from **HTML/CSS**, **JavaScript** (React & Vue), to **API development** with **MySQL** and **MongoDB**.
- üé® I love the creative side of web development, but as I've delved deeper into coding, I've discovered how thrilling it is to see my code come to life in real-time.
- üöÄ I've gained hands-on experience with **agile project work**, **graphic tools** like Figma and Photoshop, and **UX/usability** concepts.
- üß™ I'm also familiar with **e2e testing** and various other testing techniques.

### What I'm Passionate About:
- I'm drawn to **varied projects** and enjoy tackling new challenges. So far, everything I've learned has been exciting, and I'm always looking forward to more.
- I have a curious and growth-driven mindset, and I love learning from others. Whether it's a new framework, a different approach to problem-solving, or simply a cool new tool, I'm eager to dive in and explore.

### When I'm Not Coding:
- You'll find me spending time with my family, hanging out with my dog and cat, or at the stables riding horses üêé.
- I also enjoy **reading**, watching **movies** or **series**, and indulging in some good food üç≤.
